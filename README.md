🛒 Online Retail Sales Analysis – Cleaned Dataset (100K+ Rows)
This project is based on a real-world online retail dataset containing over 1 lakh+ transaction records. The raw data was messy and unstructured — I cleaned it using Excel and Power Query, then visualized key insights in Power BI.

📂 Dataset Overview
Source: Online retail transactions

Records: 100,000+ rows

Fields: Invoice, Stock Code, Description, Quantity, Invoice Date, Unit Price, Customer ID, Country

🧹 What I Did
✅ Data Cleaning (Excel + Power Query)
Removed blank rows and null CustomerID

Fixed date and number formatting

Created a new TotalSales column: Quantity × UnitPrice

Renamed columns for clarity

Removed duplicates and canceled invoices (starting with “C”)

📊 Power BI Dashboard
Created 4 KPIs:

Built 4 Visuals:
